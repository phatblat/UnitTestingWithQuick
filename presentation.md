# Quick & Nimble

Open Source

- Quick/[Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick)
  - Used to define examples.
- Quick/[Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble)
  - Matcher framework used to express expectations.

^ Core contributor
^ BDD style framework

---

# BDD

- _Behavior-Driven Development_
- Don't test code
- Verify behavior
- Semi-formal format for behavior specification
- Similar to user story
- Object-oriented design

^ Semi-formal format for behavioral specification which is borrowed from user story specifications from the field of object-oriented analysis and design.
^ Not full Gherkin syntax
^ Scenario, Given, When, Then

---

# RSpec

- Behaviour Driven Development for Ruby.
- "Making TDD Productive and Fun."

# QuickSpec

```swift

class TableOfContentsSpec: QuickSpec {
  override func spec() {
    describe("the 'Documentation' directory") {
      it("has everything you need to get started") {
        let sections = Directory("Documentation").sections
        expect(sections).to(contain("Organized Tests with Quick Examples and Example Groups"))
        expect(sections).to(contain("Installing Quick"))
      }

      context("if it doesn't have what you're looking for") {
        it("needs to be updated") {
          let you = You(awesome: true)
          expect{you.submittedAnIssue}.toEventually(beTruthy())
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

# `describe`

```swift
describe("the thing") { /* closure */ }
```

- Describes the thing being tested.
- Groups examples.
- Serves as a prefix for the actual test name.

---

# `it`

```swift
it("calculates an average score") { /* closure */ }
```

- Describes an example behavior.
- Contains assertions (expectations).
- _One expectation per example._

---

# `context`

```swift
context("when dark mode is enabled") { /* closure */ }
```

- Optional alternate 2nd-Nth level of grouping for examples.
- Arbitrary nesting. ðŸŽŽ

â€”--

# Disabled Test (Quick)

```swift
xit("this example is disabled") { code.compiles() == yes }
```

- Prefix any example with `x` to disable.
- `xit`

^ I don't recommend commenting out tests because code won't compile
^ If you don't want it to compile, delete it

â€”--

# Disabled Test (Xcode)

- Must edit scheme to disable tests.
- Shows test method as disabled.

Scheme > Test action|Test Navigator
---|---

^ Test configuration separate from tests.
^ Had CI not honor test configuration in scheme.

â€”--

# âœ¨ Disabled Test Suite

```swift
xdescribe("the thing") {
xcontext("when dark mode is enabled") {
xit("this example is disabled") { code.compiles() == yes }
```

- Prefix any Quick function(s) with `x` to disable everything under that scope.
- Any combination of disabled examples is skipped.

â€”--

# âœ¨ Focused Test

```swift
fit("is focused") { expect(example).toRun(true) }
it("will be ignored") { code.compiles() == yes }
```

- Prefix any example with `f` to focus.
- Only the focused example(s) will be run.

â€”--

# âœ¨ Focused Test Suites


```swift
fdescribe("the thing") {
fcontext("when dark mode is enabled") {
fit("is focused") { expect(example).toRun(true) }
```

- Prefix any Quick function(s) with `f` to focus everything under that scope.
- Only the focused example(s) will be run.
- All focused examples will be run.

---

# Quick Caveats

- Easy to forget disabled/focused tests.
- Clicking on Quick example in Test Navigator doesn't navigate to code.

â€”--

# Xcode UI

# Test Name

# Type Handling

# Nimble

- Matcher framework
- Swift and Objective-C

```swift
expect(1 + 1).to(equal(2))
expect(1.2).to(beCloseTo(1.1, within: 0.1))
expect(3) > 2
expect("seahorse").to(contain("sea"))
expect(["Atlantic", "Pacific"]).toNot(contain("Mississippi"))
```


---

# Custom Failure Message

```swift
expect(1 + 1).to(equal(3))
// failed - expected to equal <3>, got <2>

expect(1 + 1).to(equal(3), description: "Make sure libKindergartenMath is loaded")
// failed - Make sure libKindergartenMath is loaded
// expected to equal <3>, got <2>
```

â€”--

# Async Test

```swift
expect(ocean.isClean).toEventually(beTruthy())
```
